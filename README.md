A Kerbal name generator

https://www.jacob-swanson.com/kerbonaut-naming/

## How is a Kerbal name generated?
First the gender is decided.
Each name has a 1/2 chance of being either male or female.

Then the name has a 1/20 chance of being a proper name chosen from a list and a 19/20 chance of being combined from a list of prefixes and suffixes.
A random prefix and suffix is chosen.
There is a seperate list of proper names, prefixes, and suffixes for each gender.

There is also a list of phrases that are not allowed in Kerbal names such as "aaa", "aae", and "eae".
If a name contains one of these phrases, a new one is generated.
